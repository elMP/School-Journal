# School-Journal
Project "School Journal"
We have in our minds to create a school journal targeted mostly at Ukraine, Poland and other countries which don’t have a unified digitalized school journal yet. The purpose of the journal is to provide parents and teachers with the one platform for communication and information about schedule, curriculum, pupils’ marks, successes and extra activities.
The minimum operational functionality of the “School Journal” will include the following features:
-    Students list
-    Teachers list
-    Sending and receiving messages 
-    Homework assignments
-    Pupils marks 
-    Additional teacher’s remarks
The above are only essential features and it is possible to expand the journal functionality with additional features that parents and teachers will deem necessary.
